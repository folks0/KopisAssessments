# KopisAssessments

This will be used for simple assessments and sample projects.

# Frontend (Angular)

The frontend is almost complete, with just one missing function. Your task is to implement the "Add to Cart" functionality on the product details page (product-details.component.ts). When the "Add to Cart" button is clicked, the selected product should be added to the cart array.

Also you should build a simple "Show My Cart" page to display the items in your cart similar to the list of products.

# Backend (Node.js)

The backend is partially completed. You need to implement the following API endpoints:

GET /api/getProducts: Retrieve a list of mocked products.
GET /api/products/:id: Retrieve details of a specific product based on the provided ID.
GET /api/getCart: Retrieve a list of items in the cart.
GET /api/addToCart/:id: Add item to the cart and get a count of items.

# Mocked Data

The backend provides mocked data for products. The data is stored in backend/data/products.js.

# Your Task

Implement the missing "Add to Cart" functionality and "Show My Cart" in the frontend.
Implement the backend API endpoints as specified above.

# Submission

Please create a zip archive of your completed project (including the code and updated README) and send it to us.
